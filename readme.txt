Embed beautiful and feature-rich tables into your posts and pages, without having to write code.

== Description ==

TablePress is the most popular and highest rated WordPress table plugin. It allows you to easily create and manage beautiful tables on your website. You can embed the tables into posts, pages, or other site areas using a block in the block editor. Table data can be edited in a spreadsheet-like interface, without any coding. Tables can contain any type of data, even math formulas that will be evaluated. Additional features like sorting, pagination, and filtering make it easy for site visitors to interact with the table data. Tables can be imported and exported from/to Excel, CSV, HTML, and JSON files.

**Even more great features for you and your site’s visitors and priority email support are available with a Premium license plan of TablePress. [Go check them out!](https://tablepress.org/premium/)**
