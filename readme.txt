* Bugfix: The table width is correct again, when using the “Scroll” mode of the “Responsive Tables” feature module. (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* Bugfix: The “Responsive Tables” feature module’s “Stack” mode now properly handles tables with combined cells. (TablePress Pro and Max only.)

* Cleaned up and simplified code, for easier future maintenance, to follow WordPress Coding Standards, and to offer helpful inline documentation.
* Several external code libraries and build tools have been updated to benefit from enhancements and bug fixes.

= Version 2.4 (July 16, 2024) =

**New and improved features**

* A *new “Fuzzy Search” feature module* allows the visitor to find similar and not just exact search matches. This is useful when e.g. searching for words with the same pronunciation but different spelling. (TablePress Max only.)
* The “Column Filter Dropdowns” feature module now allows specifying which columns should get a dropdown, and it’s possible to change their order! (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* Similarly, the “Search Panes” feature module now allows specifying which columns should get a search pane. (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* The “Fixed Columns” feature module now also allows the visitor to scroll left and right by clicking arrow buttons (see below for more). (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* The “Row Order” feature module now allows ordering a table by multiple columns at the same time! (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* The “Server-side Processing” feature module can automatically refresh the shown data after a configured interval, so that the visitor will always see the latest data. (TablePress Max only.)
* The “Row Order” and “Server-side Processing” feature modules now sort non-numeric columns “naturally” and case-insensitive. (TablePress Pro and Max only.)
* The “REST API” feature module now supports pagination and ordering request parameters and sends corresponding HTTP headers for easier integration. (TablePress Max only.)

**The “Responsive Tables” and “Fixed Columns” premium modules offer more possibilities**

* The “Scroll” mode’s arrow buttons now stick to the top of the page, making them easier to use in long tables.
* In addition, they will now only be shown if a table actually needs horizontal scrolling!
* They also scroll the table in the expected direction now.
* And even better: These scroll arrow buttons are now also available when using the “Fixed Columns” feature module!
* When using the “Scroll” mode, the table name, description, and control elements like the Search now remain in place.
* In the “Flip” mode, the sorting arrows are now properly rotated.
* The “Stack” no longer conflicts with the “Fixed Columns” feature.
* The Safari browser on iOS will no longer unexpectedly change font sizes.

**Miscellaneous changes**

* TablePress warns that certain activated but retired TablePress Extensions will stop working with TablePress 3.0, later this year.
* TablePress actively prevents conflicts with overwritten menu items in the dashboard’s admin menu.
* The user interface experience on the “Edit” screen was improved.
* The size of “Custom CSS” code will be reduced even further, if the code has comments.
* The “Automatic Table Export” feature module now properly detects automatic periodic table imports. (TablePress Max only.)
* The “Automatic Periodic Table Import” feature module’s configuration screen now has better spacing. (TablePress Max only.)
* The “Server-side Processing” feature module checks for potential conflicts with incompatible features. (TablePress Max only.)

**Behind the scenes**

* Cleaned up and simplified code, for easier future maintenance, to follow WordPress Coding Standards, and to offer helpful inline documentation.
* Updated external libraries to benefit from enhancements and bug fixes.
* Automated code compatibility checks and build tools simplify chores for easier development.

**Premium versions**

* Even more great features for you and your site’s visitors and priority email support are available with a Premium license plan of TablePress. [Go check them out!](https://tablepress.org/premium/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=textlink&utm_content=readme)
