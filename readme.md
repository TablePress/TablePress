TablePress is a plugin for the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) publishing platform.

TablePress allows you to easily create and manage beautiful tables. You can embed the tables into posts, pages, or text widgets with a simple Shortcode. Table data can be edited in a spreadsheet-like interface, so no coding is necessary. Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. An additional JavaScript library adds features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more for site visitors. Tables can be imported and exported from/to Excel, CSV, HTML, and JSON files.

Please visit the plugin website at https://tablepress.org/ for the latest information on this plugin, or [follow @TablePress](https://twitter.com/TablePress) on Twitter.

## Installation

The easiest way to install TablePress is via your WordPress Dashboard. Go to the "Plugins" screen, click "Add New", and search for "TablePress" in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then, click "Install Now" and wait a moment. Finally, click "Activate" and start using the plugin!

Manual installation works just as for other WordPress plugins:

1. [Download](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/tablepress.latest-stable.zip) and extract the ZIP file.
1. Move the folder "tablepress" into the "wp-content/plugins/" directory of your WordPress installation.
1. Activate the plugin "TablePress" on the "Plugins" screen of your WordPress Dashboard.
1. Create and manage tables by going to the "TablePress" screen in the admin menu.
1. To insert a table into a post or page, copy its Shortcode Shortcode text for editor `[table id=<ID> /]`  and paste it into a "Shortcode" block at the desired place in the block editor. Each table has a unique ID that needs to be adjusted in that Shortcode.
1. You can change the table styling by using CSS code, which can be entered into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Where can I find answers to Frequently Asked Questions?**

Many questions, regarding different features or styling, have been answered on the [FAQ page](https://tablepress.org/faq/) on the plugin website.

**Support?**

For support questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please use the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress). Please search through the forums first, and only [create a new topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress#new-post) if you don't find an existing answer. Thank you!

**Requirements?**

In short: WordPress 5.3 or higher, while the latest version of WordPress is always recommended.

**Languages and Localization?**

TablePress uses the ["Translate WordPress" platform](https://translate.wordpress.org/). Please see the sidebar on the TablePress page in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) for available translations.

To make TablePress available in your language, go to the [TablePress translations page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tablepress), log in with a free wordpress.org account and start translating.

**Migration from WP-Table Reloaded**

TablePress is the official successor of the WP-Table Reloaded plugin. It has been rewritten from the ground up and uses an entirely new internal structure. This fixes some major flaws of WP-Table Reloaded and prepares the plugin for easier, safer, and better future development.
If you are currently using WP-Table Reloaded, it is highly recommended that you switch to TablePress. WP-Table Reloaded will no longer be maintained or developed. For further information on how to switch from WP-Table Reloaded to TablePress, please see the [migration guide](https://tablepress.org/migration-from-wp-table-reloaded/) on the plugin website.

## Usage

After installing the plugin, you can create and manage tables on the "TablePress" screen in the WordPress Dashboard.

To show one of your tables in a post or on a page, embed the Shortcode `[table id=<the-ID> /]` into a "Shortcode" block at the desired place in the block editor. Each table has a unique ID that needs to be adjusted in that Shortcode.

After that, you might want to change the styling of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen. Some examples for common styling changes can be found on the [TablePress FAQ page](https://tablepress.org/faq/).

You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, ...) by enabling the corresponding checkboxes on a table's "Edit" screen.
