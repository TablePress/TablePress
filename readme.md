TablePress is a plugin for the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) publishing platform.

TablePress allows you to easily create and manage beautiful tables. You can embed the tables into posts, pages, or text widgets with a simple Shortcode. Table data can be edited in a speadsheet-like interface, so no coding is necessary. Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. An additional JavaScript library adds features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more for site visitors. Tables can be imported and exported from/to Excel, CSV, HTML, and JSON files.

Please visit the plugin website at https://tablepress.org/ for the latest information on this plugin, or [follow @TablePress](https://twitter.com/TablePress) on Twitter.

1. Create and manage tables by going to the "TablePress" screen in the admin menu.
1. Add a table to a page, post, or text widget, by embedding the Shortcode `[table id=<your-table's-ID> /]` into its content, or by using the "Table" button in the editor toolbar.
1. You can change the table styling by using CSS code, which can be entered into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Where can I find answers to Frequently Asked Questions?**

Many questions, regarding different features or styling, have been answered on the [FAQ page](https://tablepress.org/faq/) on the plugin website.

**Support?**

For support questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please use the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress). Please [search](https://wordpress.org/support/) through the forums first, and only [open a new thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tablepress) if you don't find an existing answer. Thank you!

**Requirements?**

In short: WordPress 4.7 or higher, while the latest version of WordPress is always recommended.

**Languages and Localization?**

TablePress supports the ["Translate WordPress" platform](https://translate.wordpress.org/). With that, translating is possible on a website from which so-called Language Packs are automatically generated and shipped to plugin users. For a list of existing Language Packs, please see the sidebar on the TablePress page in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/).

It is therefore no longer necessary to generate and translate *.po and *.mo files manually. Instead, just go to the [TablePress translations page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tablepress), log in with a free wordpress.org account and start translating TablePress into your language.

If you want to become a Translation Editor for your language, who can confirm or reject translation suggestions by other users, please get in touch.

**Migration from WP-Table Reloaded**

TablePress is the official successor of the WP-Table Reloaded plugin. It has been rewritten from the ground up and uses an entirely new internal structure. This fixes some major flaws of WP-Table Reloaded and prepares the plugin for easier, safer, and better future development.
If you are currently using WP-Table Reloaded, it is highly recommended that you switch to TablePress. WP-Table Reloaded will no longer be maintained or developed. For further information on how to switch from WP-Table Reloaded to TablePress, please see the [migration guide](https://tablepress.org/migration-from-wp-table-reloaded/) on the plugin website.

## Usage

After installing the plugin, you can create and manage tables on the "TablePress" screen in the WordPress Dashboard.
Everything should be self-explaining there.

To show one of your tables in a post, on a page, or in a text widget, just embed the Shortcode `[table id=<the-ID> /]` into the post/page/text widget, where `<the-ID>` is the ID of your table (can be found on the left side of the "All Tables" screen.)
Alternatively, you can also insert tables by clicking the "Table" button in the editor toolbar, and then selecting the desired table.

After that, you might want to change the styling of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen. Some examples for common styling changes can be found on the [TablePress FAQ page](https://tablepress.org/faq/).

You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, ...) by enabling the corresponding checkboxes on a table's "Edit" screen.
