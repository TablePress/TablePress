TablePress is a plugin for the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) publishing platform.

TablePress allows you to easily create and manage beautiful tables. You can embed the tables into posts, pages, or other site areas using a block in the block editor. Table data can be edited in a spreadsheet-like interface, so no coding is necessary. Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. Additional features like sorting, pagination, and filtering make it easy for site visitors to interact with the table data. Tables can be imported and exported from/to Excel, CSV, HTML, and JSON files.

Please visit the plugin website at [tablepress.org](https://tablepress.org/) for the latest information on this plugin, or [follow @TablePress](https://twitter.com/TablePress) on Twitter.
